# QuoteBot-Quote-Repo
A repository for storing quotes for a QOTD bot on a Discord server.

To add a quote, make a pull request.

Formatting:

NAME = the name of who sumbitted it, ideally a Discord tag, remember the case!
DELIM = ###
QUOTE = the quote, two spaces after a full stop, a space before a ~ if adding a reference and then no full stop at the end.

Like so:

Gnome###Hello, World! ~Brian Kernighan
