# QuoteBotRepo

A repository for the QOTD bot on the swan_hack Discord server.

To add a quote, fork and make a pull request.. hopefully it provides you less pain than it did me!

Formatting:

NAMEDELIMQUOTE

NAME = the name of who submitted it, ideally a Discord tag, remember the case!

DELIM = ###

QUOTE = the quote, two spaces after a full stop, a space before a ~ if adding a reference, then no full stop after that.

Like so:

Gnome###Hello, World! ~Brian Kernighan
