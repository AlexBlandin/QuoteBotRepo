Gnome###A programmer is a person who passes as an exacting expert on the basis of being able to turn out, after innumerable punching, an infinite series of incomprehensive answers calculated with micrometric precisions from vague assumptions based on debatable figures taken from inconclusive documents and carried out on instruments of problematical accuracy by persons of dubious reliability and questionable mentality for the avowed purpose of annoying and confounding a hopelessly defenseless department that was unfortunate enough to ask for the information in the first place.
Gnome###Computer science education cannot make anybody an expert programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make somebody an expert painter.

Viruses will, from time to time, trash your hard disk - okay, Windows does that too.\n4.  Viruses are usually carried, unknown to the user, along with valuable programs and systems.  Sigh... Windows does that, too.\n5. Viruses will occasionally make the user suspect their system is too slow (see 2) and the user will buy new hardware.  Yup, that's with Windows, too.\k\kUntil now it seems Windows is a virus but there are fundamental differences: Viruses are well supported by their authors, are running on most systems, their program code is fast, compact and efficient and they tend to become more sophisticated as they mature.  So Windows is not a virus.\n\nIt's a bug.

The squaw on the bear had a baby boy, the squaw on the buffalo hide had a baby girl.  But the squaw on the hippopotamus had a girl and a boy.

Gnome###Two possibilities exist: either we are alone in the Universe or we are not.  Both are equally terrifying. ~Authur C. Clarke
Gnome###I think one of the reasons why anthropogenic climate change is so difficult for a certain type of person to accept is that atmospheres seem ethereal and tenuous and incapable of trapping enough heat to modify the temperature on a planet significantly.  For such people I suggest a trip to Venus, where they will be squashed and boiled and dissolved on the surface of Earth's twin. ~Professor Brian Cox
Gnome###We need to shift our focus.  We live in a solar system of wonders, of planets of storms and moons of ice, of landscapes and vistas that stir the imagination and enrich the soul - a system of limitless resources, limitless beauty, and limitless potential.  If we don't go there, we'll never go anywhere.  And if we go nowhere, then we'll have no future at all. ~Professor Brian Cox
segfault###PHP is a minor evil perpetrated and created by incompetent amateurs, whereas Perl is a great and insidious evil perpetrated by skilled but perverted professionals. ~Jon Ribbens

Gnome###I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.  Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion.  I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate.  All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.  Time to die. ~Roy Batty
Gnome###The time will come when diligent research over long periods will bring to light things which now lie hidden.  A single lifetime, even though entirely devoted to the sky, would not be enough for the investigation of so vast a subject, and so this knowledge will be unfolded only through long successive ages.  There will come a time when our descendants will be amazed that we did not know things that are so plain to them .. Many discoveries are reserved for ages still to come, when memory of us will have been effaced.  Our Universe is a sorry little affair unless it has in it something for every age to investigate .. Nature does not reveal her mysteries once and for all. ~Seneca, Natural Questions, Book 7, first century
Gnome###The known is finite, the unknown infinite; intellectually we stand on an islet in the midst of an illimitable ocean of inexplicability.  Our business in every generation is to reclaim a little more land. ~T. H. Huxley, 1887
Gnome###Do there exist many worlds, or is there but a single world?  This is one of the most noble and exalted questions in the study of Nature. ~Albertus Magnus, thirteenth century
Volanti###I literally borked the autograder with a puny infinite loop. ~Volanti
segfault###Honestly, a lot of free software is free as in piano -- It's right there. Nobody is stopping you.  You could totally spend hours of painstaking labor getting it carried up your front steps or built from a clusterfuck of diffs and patches or whatever.  Everyone knows you won't. ~Leah Velleman, twitter

meetowl###In a certain sense, every program on Windows begins by asking itself the perennial question: am I the 1998 Barbie Riding Club game, or can I run the program normally? ~Pwn All The Things, Twitter
Victor###Okay, Okay -- I admit it.  You didn't change that program that worked just a little while ago; I inserted some random characters into the executable.  Please forgive me.  You can recover the file by typing in the code over again, since I also removed the source. ~`fortune`
